# Data-Analytics-on-Uber
### Abstract
With market competition stiffening, top organizations are turning to data analytics to
identify new market opportunities for their services and products. As things stand
today, 77% of top organizations consider data analytics a critical component of
business performance. Uber Rides Analysis is a data visualization based project
where data is analysed. This is a private cab service where in each individual owning
a car can serve and earn as well for quite a low price. In this report I have considered
the Uber rides data and analysed them for months of April 2014 to September 2014.
Compared this data set with other cab service data sets to analyse this data set
more and also compared its data for a week day and weekend to observe any
patterns in these specific times too. Thus, came up to an analysis showing some
amazing facts of this Uber pick up service.
